# Electrical-Results-ETL
A very simple ETL pipeline with the purpose of routinely ingesting .txt files containing raw test data.

The code within this repo is intended as a proof of concept and as an educational project within which, to become familiar with ETL tools and processes.

Test results are periodically written to txt files within a known directory - these results contain timestamped resistances, generated by Keithley instruments.
This ETL process is designed to check for completed test files, extract their contents, calculate metrics of interest and store these in a database. Further analysis of the generated data can be done via the dashboard.
